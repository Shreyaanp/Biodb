G2/M transition was blocked in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 after AG treatment whereas DU-145 cells failed to transit G1/S phase. This difference was primarily due to differential activation of cell cycle regulators in these cell lines. Levels of cyclin A2 after AG treatment increased in all PCa cells line. Cyclin B1 levels increased in LNCaP and PC3, decreased in C4-2b and showed no difference in DU-145 cells after AG treatment. AG decreased cyclin E2 levels only in PC3 and DU-145 cells. It also altered Rb, H3, Wee1 and CDC2 phosphorylation in PCa cells. Intriguingly, AG reduced cell viability and the ability of PCa cells to migrate via modulating CXCL11 and CXCR3 and CXCR7 expression. The significant impact of AG on cellular and molecular processes involved in PCa progression suggests its potential use as a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for PCa.",DOI:10.1080/15384101.2016.1148836

The phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and PI3K-III, LC3-II and Beclin-1 protein levels in J5 cells were increased after ?-PA treatment (p < 0.05). In addition, ?-PA up-regulated nuclear p53 and down-regulated cytoplasmic p53 expression in J5 cells. The NF-?B pathway was activated, as indicated by increase in cytosolic phosphorylated I?B, nuclear NF-?B levels, and the DNA-binding activity of NF-?B after ?-PA treatment in J5 cells (p < 0.05).

Through time-course analysis and inhibition of the ROS-related signaling pathway (upstream by vitamin C and downstream by PLAB silencing), we demonstrated that the antimitotic activity of 4-oxo-4-HPR was independent from the oxidative stress induced by the retinoid. In fact, ROS generation occurred earlier than mitotic arrest (within 30 minutes and 2 hours, respectively) and abrogation of the ROS-related signaling pathway did not prevent the 4-oxo-4-HPR-induced mitotic arrest.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013362

While lack of the NF-?B-p65 protein had no effect on the activity of SQP, lung cancer cells that expressed p53 were more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of SQP than were cells that lacked p53 expression. SQP was also found to be highly effective in suppressing cancer cell colony formation and inducing apoptosis, as shown by assays of intracellular esterase activity, plasma membrane integrity, and cell-cycle phase. SQP was found to induce cytochrome c release and activate caspases that lead to poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. SQP exposure was associated with downregulation of cell survival proteins such cFLIP, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, c-IAP1, and survivin.

More interestingly, this effect was also observed in chemoresistant cells, underlining the immense potential of Calebin A as a chemopreventive/chemosensitivity agent to improve and enhance standard therapeutic approaches. Recently, it was shown that Calebin A exhibits anti-oxidant activity and inhibits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and further mediates its anti-cancer effects by inhibiting P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Calebin A also targets the NF-?B pathway, thereby suppressing cell survival and expression of NF-?B-regulated gene end-products, leading to the inhibition of cell growth and chemosensitization 
The potential modulating role of Calebin A in TNF-?-induced NF-?B mediated inflammatory signaling in colon cancer cells is unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated, for the first time, the efficacy of Calebin A on suppressing TNF-?-induced NF-?B mediated malignity in CRC cells in vitro.Calebin A interacts directly with cysteine residues of p65-NF-?B, thereby suppressing the recombinant binding of p65 to DNA [27]. Furthermore, several reports have demonstrated that a residue Cyc38 of p65-NF-?B is essential for the specific binding/interaction to the DNA in different tumor cells.Calebin A, and this was also inhibited in the same way by the knockdown of NF-?B on mRNA level using ASO-NF-?B, or on the IKK level by BMS-345541 (specific IKK-inhibitor) or by curcumin (natural inhibitor of NF-?B), may be essential mechanisms for Calebin A’s antitumorigenic potential in this inflammatory tumor environment","PMCID: PMC6950382

By blocking the PSMB10 proteasome subunit, downregulation of ANXA4, potential association with HDAC6 and upregulation of HMOX1, WA puts a massive blockage on both proteotoxic and oxidative stress responses pathways, leaving cancer cells defenseless against WA induced stresses.Exposure of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) cells with varying concentrations of withaferin-A resulted in the apoptosis induction characterized by the cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, and the condensation and fragmentation of DNA without inducing similar effects in MCF-10A cells. The apoptosis induction in these cells was associated with decreased expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bim-S and Bim-EL that was negated upon silencing with forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), a transcriptional regulator of Bim .

Both the western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay showed that 4?HWE promoted the phosphorylation and degradation of ?-catenin and the subsequent inhibition of its nuclear translocation to attenuate the endogenous Wnt target gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The cell viability assay indicated that 4?HWE preferentially inhibited the proliferation of CRC compared with CCD-841-CoN, a normal human colonic epithelial cell line. 4?HWE-mediated G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction contributed to the suppression of the proliferation of CRC in the cell cycle and Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide apoptosis analysis.

STAT3 is active in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatments.144–146 Telomerase activity is another important factor in promoting carcinogenesis and evading senescense, thus inducing cancer cell immortality; silymarin has the ability to decrease telomerase activity in prostate cancer cells.According to Zi and Agarwal, low doses of silymarin inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 Map kinases in a skin cancer cell line (human epidermoid carcinoma A431) and at higher doses activated MAPK/JNK1. This means that at lower doses the effect was antiproliferative and at higher doses proapoptotic.Treating prostate carcinoma cells with silymarin the levels of PSA were significantly decreased and cell growth was inhibited through decreased CDK activity and induction of Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27.","PMCID: PMC8814827

D-Galactose (D-gal) can induce oxidative stress in non-cancer cells and result in cell damage by disturbing glucose metabolism. However, the
effect of D-gal on cancer cells is yet to be explored. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of D-gal to malignant cells specifically
neuroblastoma cells. As the results, high concentrations of D-gal had significant toxicity to cancer cells, whereas the same concentrations of
glucose had no; the viability loss via D-gal treatment was prominent to malignant cells (Neuro2a, SH-SY5Y, PC-3, and HepG2) comparing to
non-malignant cells (NIH3T3 and LO2). Differing from the apoptosis induced by H2O2, D-gal damaged cells showed the characters of necrotic
cell death, such as trypan blue-tangible and early phase LDH leakage. Further experiments displayed that the toxic effect of D-gal can be
alleviated by necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin (Nec-1) and autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) but not by caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk. D-Gal treatment can transcriptionally up-regulate the genes relevant to necroptosis (Bmf, Bnip3) and autophagy (Atg5, TIGAR) but not
the genes related to apoptosis (Caspase3, Bax, and p53). D-Gal did not activate Caspase-3, but prompted puncta-like GFP–LC3 distribution, an
indicator for activated autophagy", DOI 10.1002/jcb.23314 

As a C-3 epimer of D-fructose, L-sorbose is internalized via the transporter GLUT5 and phosphorylated by ketohexokinase (KHK) to produce L-sorbose-1-phosphate (S-1-P). Cellular S-1-P inactivates the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase resulting in attenuated glycolysis. Consequently, mitochondrial function is impaired and reactive oxygen species are produced. Moreover, L-sorbose downregulates the transcription of KHK-A, a splicing variant of KHK. Since KHK-A is a positive inducer of antioxidation genes, the antioxidant defense mechanism in cancer cells can be attenuated by L-sorbose-treatment. Thus, L-sorbose performs multiple anticancer activities to induce cell apoptosis. In mouse xenograft models, L-sorbose enhances the effect of tumor chemotherapy in combination with other anticancer drugs. These results demonstrate L-sorbose as an attractive therapeutic reagent for cancer treatment.","Rare sugar L-sorbose exerts antitumor activity by impairing glucose metabolism

The recruitment of FADD triggers the conscription of Pro-caspase 8 in saponin treated cancer cells to form death induced signaling complex (DISC) [63,65]. Upon recruitment, procaspase-8 is released from DISC as the active caspase-8 via a proximity-induced activation mechanism. Activation of caspase-8 leads to downstream activation of the executioner caspase-3 and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) mediating the proteolysis of cellular components [66]. Caspase-8 activation is the defining factor in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and activation of this protein can be induced by different saponins [67].
Cellular activation of caspase-8 by saponins via the intrinsic pathway might not be sufficient to induce apoptosis [64]; as a result, some saponins rely on cell death machinery via the BCl-2 family of protein (Bid) which mediates crosstalk with the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [68]. Caspase-8 activates tBid by protein cleavage to form an active Bid, which subsequently activates downstream pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, causing mitochondria membrane permeabilization and activation of effector caspases [69]. Furthermore, since p53 mutation in cancer cells can inhibit apoptosis in the intrinsic pathway, this pathway of cell death offers an alternative route of eliminating cancer in p53 mutant cells","PMCID: PMC9386697

Further verification of these changes via qRT-PCR and western blot assays in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that AA could suppress human EC cell migration and invasion through Ras/ERK/MAPK pathway.

The mechanisms of action include apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways. The cancer prevention is mostly achieved by inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells through increasing the apoptosis [9,10,11]. Indeed, kaempferol inhibits various cancer cells by triggering apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, downregulation of signaling pathways and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers (N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Snail, and Slug), and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), metastasis-related markers [12,13]. Kaempferol also induces the activation of cysteine proteases involved in apoptosis initiation and execution, caspases-3, -7, -9, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) [14], therefore preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in cancer development [15]. The inhibition of angiogenesis was also reported as well as the capacity of kaempferol to preserve normal cell viability.Kaempferol also induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase via upregulation of Chk2/Cdc25C/Cdc2, DR5, DR4, JNK, CHOP, p38, p21, ERK1/2 proteins, caspase-3, -7, -8, Bad, Bax, and p53 proteins, with downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1? (HIF-1?), a regulator of VEGF expression.Kaempferol acts by downregulating the AP-1 DNA binding activity, MMP-2, -9, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) that, in turn, reduces phosphorylated p38, ERK, and JNK [110]. In BALB/c(nu/nu) mice inoculated with human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS), kaempferol significantly decreased the number of viable cells and reduced the tumor size [109]. The in vivo anti-bone cancer effects of kaempferol have also been demonstrated in BALB/c(nu/nu) mice inoculated with U-2 OS cells .Kaempferol also caused cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and downregulated Bcl-2, MMP-2, c-Jun, and hexokinase-2 expression. Kaempferol also increased glucose uptake, EGFR activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and upregulated Bax, cleaved caspase-3, -9, and PARP. Kaempferol dose-dependently inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, SNU-213, Panic-1, and Miapaca-2, through inducing apoptosis [75] and effectively inhibiting cell migration, ERK1/2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related Src, and AKT pathways [76]. Kaempferol also improves the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by increasing the FOXP3 expression level. kaempferol in combination with tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRAIL) led to apoptosis in colon cancer cells, through up-regulation of TRAIL receptors and death receptor 5 (DR5) that improved the TRAIL activity [67]. Generally, kaempferol induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and reduces both cell migration and invasion [64,66]. Kaempferol also blocked ROS production and modulated the expression of MAPK, JAK/STAT3, PI3K/AKT, ATM, H2A histone family member X (H2AX), phospho-p38, p21, p53, PARP, caspase-3, -7, -8, -9, Bcl-2, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, connexin 43, ERK-1/2, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B). Also, kaempferol significantly reduced insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II secretion, and heregulin (HRG)-?, CDK2, CDK4, Cdc25C, Cdc2, cyclins B1, D1, E, A, and connexin 43 expressions. Finally, it also suppressed the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and enhanced the PARP cleavages.",https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24122277

The recruitment of FADD triggers the conscription of Pro-caspase 8 in saponin treated cancer cells to form death induced signaling complex (DISC) [63,65]. Upon recruitment, procaspase-8 is released from DISC as the active caspase-8 via a proximity-induced activation mechanism. Activation of caspase-8 leads to downstream activation of the executioner caspase-3 and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) mediating the proteolysis of cellular components [66]. Caspase-8 activation is the defining factor in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, and activation of this protein can be induced by different saponins [67].
Cellular activation of caspase-8 by saponins via the intrinsic pathway might not be sufficient to induce apoptosis [64]; as a result, some saponins rely on cell death machinery via the BCl-2 family of protein (Bid) which mediates crosstalk with the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [68]. Caspase-8 activates tBid by protein cleavage to form an active Bid, which subsequently activates downstream pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, causing mitochondria membrane permeabilization and activation of effector caspases [69]. Furthermore, since p53 mutation in cancer cells can inhibit apoptosis in the intrinsic pathway, this pathway of cell death offers an alternative route of eliminating cancer in p53 mutant cells","PMCID: PMC9386697

PTX also reduces glycolysis in melanoma cells.While PTX mainly induces the apoptosis targeting tubulin, PTX has been found to target mitochondria and inhibit the function of the apoptotic inhibitor protein B-cell Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) [67]. However, there is a controversial situation arising regarding the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 affected by PTX. Some researchers have reported that the cytotoxicity of PTX retained its ability to cause Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation, while others reported that the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 coincided with apoptosis (Figure 3) [80,81,82]. Apoptosis does not immediately occur after exposure to PTX, while the duration of the exposure and constant Bcl-2 phosphorylation appeared to contribute to the drug’s cytotoxicity [83]. On the other hand, phosphorylated Bcl-2 was independently proven not to dimerize with BAX. In this context, the unassociated BAX is responsible for apoptosis on the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 [81]. Furthermore, there is an indication that PTX may block the cell cycle at G1 (Figure 3), activating the mitogen-activated protein/microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase, increasing the production of tumor necrosis factor and activating liposaccharide-inducible genes [84,85]. The transcriptional upregulation of the interleukin-1 upon treatment with PTX also has been reported, and is probably associated with its ability to activate nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) [86,87]. PTX induced the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in the presence of a functional c-raf-1 (an upstream regulator of MAP kinase) [88].

For example, cyanidin?3?glucoside (C?3?G), delphinidin?3?glucoside and petunidin?3?glucoside inhibit the activation of NF??B induced by external stimuli (e.g. LPS or IFN??) by acting on the PI3K/PKB and MAPK pathways (Afaq et al., 2005; Limtrakul et al., 2015) and can inhibit the expression of COX?2 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), as well as the production of their products PGE2 and NO (Haseeb et al., 2013; Jeong et al., 2013; Peiffer et al., 2014). Miyake et al. (2012) and Burton et al. (2015) found that anthocyanins could also block the activation of STAT3 and inhibit the expression of NF??B. anthocyanins prevent carcinogenesis by targeting the MAPK pathway and AP?1 and by inhibiting RTK activity and its signal cascade pathway to regulate the expression of cancer?related genes, which leads to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. At the development stage, anthocyanins induce apoptosis of cancer cells by activating caspase, mediated by ROS and JNK/p38?MAPK. In addition, anthocyanins inhibit cancer metastasis by targeting the VEGF signal pathway and extracellular matrix degradation.Increasing evidence indicates that the main molecular mechanism of their antitumour effects lies in inhibiting the cancer cell growth and metastasis by targeting RTKs (EGFR, PDGFR and VEGF/VEGFR) by acting on Ras?MAPK and PI3K/Akt signal cascade pathways. At the initial stage, anthocyanin inhibits inflammation by acting on the PI3K/Akt and NF??B pathway to suppress the expression of COX?2 and iNOS, thus preventing normal cells from transformation by regulating the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes to achieve antioxidation through Nrf2/ARE signal system.","PMCID: PMC5429338

Reactive oxygen species can lead to lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and triggers apoptotic pathways of cell death [10]. Candidate genes that may modulate this pathway involve those capable of the oxidation reaction (NADH dehydrogenases, nitric oxide synthases, xanthine oxidase) [11,12] and those capable of deactivating the free radicals such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Alternatively, doxorubicin can enter the nucleus and poison topoisomerase-II, also resulting in DNA damage and cell death [13]. Candidate pharmacogenes for this part of the pathway include the enzymes involved in the DNA repair mechanisms and the cell cycle control (TOP2A, MLH1, MSH2, TP53, and ERCC2 genes).","PMCID: PMC3116111

Trigonelline inhibited Nrf2 via reduced activation of EGFR signalling pathway and its downstream effector ERK 1/2 kinase. Trigonelline in combination with Cisplatin/Etoposide abrogated proliferation of NSCLC cells (A549, NCIH460 and NCIH1299) without showing any visible cytotoxicity to the normal lung epithelial cell (L132). Combinatorial treatment of Trigonelline with Cisplatin/Etoposide showed strong synergism at a sufficiently low concentration than the IC50 values of these drugs. Nrf2 knockdown experiment in NSCLC cells obliterated the effect of Trigonelline- Cisplatin and Trigonelline-Etoposide combination, indicating the role of Nrf2 inhibition in augmenting drug sensitivity. Our study demonstrated that Trigonelline blocks Nrf2 activation and its nuclear translocation via inhibition of EGFR signalling pathway. ",PMID: 33148531 DOI: 10.1016/j.tiv.2020.105038

It has been reported that ?-T induces growth arrest in PC-3 prostate cancer cells through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?)-dependent mechanism.Tocopherols have been known to dephosphorylate Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cell growth, survival, metabolism and motility [56]. A recent study demonstrated that ?-T and ?-T facilitate dephosphorylation of Akt in PTEN deficient 3 prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC-3 through activation of PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase, isoform 1 (PHLPP1), a phosphatase that dephosphorylates Akt at Ser473. ?-T and ?-T were shown to inhibit mammary tumor growth in NMU-induced Sprague Dawley rats, but did not prevent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu)-driven tumorigenesis [9]. In the August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) rat model, ?-TmT reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress and upregulated Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response in estrogen-induced early mammary hyperplasia [58]. At later stages of hyperplasia, dietary ?-TmT inhibited oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and regulated the expression of nuclear receptors ER? and PPAR? to inhibit cell proliferation in ACI rats. ?-T has been found to enhance the apoptotic effects of lovastatin, a HMG (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl)-CoA reductase inhibitor, in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HT29 by induction of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation","PMCID: PMC4899293

The molecular targets by ?-cryptoxanthin and lycopene, offer new opportunities to further our understanding of common and distinct mechanisms that involve carotenoids in cancer prevention.

Delphinidin reduces RTK activity and targets the MAPK pathway as well as the activator protein 1 (AP-1) factor, which may help to avoid malignant transformation during the beginning of cancer .Delphinidin suppressed the growth of PC-3 cells by blocking the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway . Delphinidin has been shown to downregulate the expression of ?-catenin, its downstream target protein expression, and inhibit its nuclear translocation. Expressions of the proteins of the destruction complex of ?-catenin were enhanced. delphinidin causes caspase-mediated apoptosis, leading to HDAC3 inactivation and cleavage, by increasing caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-8 activity and by activating and stabilizing p53 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These findings reveal that delphinidin causes p53-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells by decreasing HDAC activity and promoting p53 acetylation. As a result, delphinidin could be beneficial in preventing prostate cancer [29]. In another study, delphinidin-3-glucoside exhibits inhibitory effects on cell growth induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in LNCaP cells. This might be associated with the abrogation of the nuclear accumulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and the reduced expressions of steroid 5?-reductase type 1 and prostate-specific antigen, induced by DHT .Delphinidin increased the rate of apoptosis in SKOV3 cells by inducing DNA fragmentation. The study describes the synergistic effect of delphinidin with paclitaxel (an anticancer drug) in SKOV3 cells. In a similar line, another study found that delphinidin had a more significant inhibitory effect on ES2 (representative of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma) cells in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of signaling pathways, including LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor), and SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor). Delphinidin suppressed phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2/JNK, resulting in antiproliferative and anti-metastatic activities .delphinidin treatment triggered caspase activation and PARP cleavage, two legitimate apoptotic pathways in HCT-116 cells. Delphinidin increased the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (BAX, a proapoptotic protein) while decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 (an antiapoptotic protein), causing cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the G2/M phase. Delphinidin boosted the tumor suppressor protein p53 as well as its downstream target p21. Both cyclin B1 and cell division cycle 2 kinase (cdc2) expression were dose-dependently reduced. The study discovered that treating HCT-116 cells with delphinidin-induced apoptosis and downregulation of the NF-?B pathway, as evidenced by the reduced I?B phosphorylation, lowered p65 subunit expression and suppressed NF-?B nuclear translocation (Table 1) [47]. Considering the molecular mechanisms responsible for this anticancer behavior, another recent study found that delphinidin therapy inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT-3 and MAPKinase signaling pathways, as well as the production of proapoptotic protein, causing HCT-116 cells to apoptosis. Delphinidin also reduced antioxidant levels, generated ROS levels, and resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) [48]. The results are in accordance with the results obtained by Yun et al. [47], showing the antiapoptotic potential of delphinidin in HCT-116 cells.","PMCID: PMC8583959

To further prevent the invasion in breast cancer, upregulating RECK (tumor suppressor gene) and downregulating miR-21 has been reported [65,68]. ISL has been suggested to be a supplement with chemotherapy or an alternative therapeutic agent for clinical trials against breast cancer, thereby warranting further investigation. The other first-line chemotherapies for breast cancer are epirubicin, 5-FU, and Taxol. Remarkably, previous studies have also shown that ISL can interact synergistically with these first-line chemotherapy drugs through mediating cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy and suppressing breast CSCs [40,56,69]. In a preclinical study, ISL was able to shed a novel light on reversing the epigenetic changes of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF-1), which induced the demethylation of WIF-1 promoter and subsequently prevented tumor initiation by inhibiting CSCs ,The administration of ISL alone to xenograft animals significantly inhibits lung metastasis in breast cancer and suppresses the expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9/7/2 (MMP-9/7/2), NF-?B, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [57,63,64,66]. Concerning the inhibition of the tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer, ISL can rectify the abnormal PI3K/AKT, NF-kB, and p38 signaling pathways in order to reduce the occurrence of metastasis through correcting the expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, VEGF, and HIF-1? [39,57,65,66,67]. Moreover, ISL hampers breast cancer growth and the neoangiogenesis accompanying suppressed VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling, which prompts HIF-1? proteasome degradation or directly blocks VEGF-2 (Figure 3) [39]. ISL inhibited the multiple mRNA expression of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) in an arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network, as well as decreased the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and phosphorylation of PI3K. Meanwhile, in an in vivo test, ISL interferes with the AA metabolic enzyme to suppress the tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice [66].To inhibit glycolysis and lactate generation in a tumor, ISL mediates HIF-1? stability and inhibits the AMPK and AKT/mTOR pathway. This phenomenon had been found in colon cell lines and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells [27,103]. More importantly, this downregulation of AA-metabolizing enzymes and the deactivating PI3K/AKT phenomena can also be observed in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice in vivo [66]. ISL not only affects the metabolic pathway, but it also inhibits tumor growth via prompting apoptosis and autophagy. In the study of Auyeung et al. (2010) [74], ISL inhibited tumor growth throughout the downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), arrested in G2. Moreover, ISL remarkably reduces PGE2 and nitric oxide (NO) production to induce apoptosis in mouse and human colon carcinoma cells [76]. Compared to the chemotherapy treatments in colon cancer, capecitabine, 5-FU, and gemcitabine act as antimetabolites, interfering with DNA synthesis. As mentioned above, ISL can abate the metabolism and possesses a DNA demethylation effect .To inhibit glycolysis and lactate generation in a tumor, ISL mediates HIF-1? stability and inhibits the AMPK and AKT/mTOR pathway.

As mentioned above, ISL can abate the metabolism and possesses a DNA demethylation effect . ISL (IC50 = 87.0 ?M) inhibits the anticancerous effects on C4-2, LNCaP prostate cancer cells, by the reduction of the Psi(m) that triggers apoptosis and the inhibition of the proliferation via the ERK/p38MAPK pathway [59]. The effects of ISL on prostate cancer cell line DU145 have been investigated, finding that cell cycle arrest in the G2M phase decreases CDC25C and increases p-CDC2 (Tyr15), cyclin B1, and p27KIP1 [115]. The anti-invasion and antimetastasis of ISL on the DU145 prostate cancer cell line have been investigated, with the findings suggesting that this mechanism could be achieved through the inhibition of JNK/AP-1 signaling and the downregulation of the reduction of µPA, MPP-9, and AP-1. Moreover, the expression of some proteins, including VEGF, integrin-?2, and ICAM, and VCAM, has also been shown to be reduced.ISL induces apoptosis via the MAPK/STAT3/NF-?B/IkB signaling pathway, ROS accumulation, and the p53-dependent pathway and reduces cell cycle-associated protein expression in HepG2 and Hep3B cells","PMCID: PMC7795842

EGCG inhibits CSCs growth and stemness in several malignancies, such as breast [199], lung [54,200], colorectal cancer [85], osteosarcoma [14], and neuroblastoma .One of the effects exerted by EGCG is the inhibition of TGF-? signaling transduction. TGF-? is a multifunctional cytokine that induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells, and it is also responsible for the maintenance of EMT, a critical event during early metastatic growth. The mechanism by which EGCG modulates TGF-? pathway has not been completely elucidated. It has been shown that the binding between TGF-? and its receptor, TGFR-II, activates two different pathways leading to EMT: the canonical Smad-dependent pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Tabuchi et al. used immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography assays to demonstrate binding between EGCG and TGFR-II protein. This interaction may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of EGCG on the expression of alpha-SMA (considered a marker of the EMT) via the TGF-beta Smad2/3 pathway in human lung fibroblast cells","PMCID: PMC6315581

Therefore, COX-1 has been identified as the main molecular target for the anti-inflammatory activity of our compounds.

These effects of apigenin were accompanied by decrease in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and increase in the active form of Bax protein. The apigenin-mediated increase in Bax was due to dissociation of Bax from Ku70 which is essential for apoptotic activity of Bax. Apigenin treatment resulted in the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases and HDAC1 protein expression, thereby increasing the acetylation of Ku70 and the dissociation of Bax resulting in apoptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, apigenin significantly reduced HDAC1 occupancy at the XIAP promoter, suggesting that histone deacetylation might be critical for XIAP downregulation. These results suggest that apigenin targets inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and Ku70–Bax interaction in the induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and in athymic nude mouse xenograft model endorsing its in vivo efficacy.","PMCID: PMC3997183

In addition, the expressions of cell cycle proteins such as CKD1, CKD2, cyclin A, and cyclin B were decreased after amygdalin administration, indicating that amygdalin inhibited cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle of PCa cells. Similarly, amygdalin exerted its antitumor effect by affecting the cell cycle of human colon cancer. The result of cDNA microarray analysis by Park et al8 showed significant differences in gene expression of SNU?C4 cells after amygdalin treatment at a dose of 5 mg/mL for 24 hours. They found that amygdalin down?regulated the cell cycle?related genes: ATP?binding cassette, exonuclease 1 (EXO1), sub?family F and topoisomerase (DNA) I (TOP1) in SNU?C4human colon cancer cells, thereby affecting tumor cell cycle, inhibiting cell proliferation and exerting its antitumor effect. These results demonstrated that amygdalin could prevent malignant proliferation of tumor cells by regulating tumor cell cycle?related proteins or genes, affecting cell cycle and inhibiting cell proliferation, especially in human PCa and colorectal cancer.Lee et al11 determined the expression levels of apoptosis?related proteins in breast cancer cells, which treated with amygdalin at various concentrations, and found that amygdalin increased the expression of pro?apoptotic protein Bax and decreased that of antiapoptotic Bcl?2 and pro? Caspase?3. At the same time, PARP cleavage was observed in breast cancer cells treated with amygdalin. These results demonstrate that amygdalin exerts its antitumor effect by regulating apoptosis?related proteins and inducing apoptosis, especially in cervical and PCa.. Amygdalin could also down?regulate the expression of integrin ?1, ?4, ILK, FAK, and ??catenin, factors known to promote cancer cell metastasis, up?regulate the expression of cadherin E (a factor known to inhibit cancer cell metastasis), and reduce the phosphorylation of AKT and RICTOR, thereby inhibiting the AKT?mTOR signaling pathway. These results suggest that amygdalin has an antimetastatic effect on NSCLC and exerts its anti?lung cancer effect by inhibiting AKT?mTOR signaling pathway.amygdalin could also markedly reduce cell cycle activator, especially cyclin B, cdk1, E? cadherin, and N?cadherin.

Treatment on PCa DU145 and LNCaP cells with amygdalin increased Bax expression while decreased Bcl?2 expression. Above all, amygdalin induced apoptosis in human PCa cell lines DU145 and LNCaP by activating caspase?3, up?regulating Bax and down?regulating Bcl?2.

These results suggested that HT-29 cells could not synthesize enough fatty acids for cell division in the presence of AA because of the suppression of lipogenesis. HT-29 cells may incorporate more AA into their membrane phospholipids to proliferate, which resulted in ER stress, thereby inducing apoptosis. AA could be used as an anti-tumorigenic agent against cancer cells in which the basal fatty acid synthase levels are low.","PMCID: PMC7646553

Meanwhile, we investigated the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway after isoorientin treatment, which was forcefully activated by isoorientin, as expected. In addition, in the PC cells that were transfected with lentivirus to interfere with the expression of the gene PRKAA1, there were no differences in the apoptosis rate and the expression of malignancy biomarkers in the tumors of the isoorientin-treated and untreated groups. we demonstrated that isoorientin has potential antitumor effects via the AMPK signaling pathway, and isoorientin merits further investigation.Isoorientin induces apoptosis, decreases invasiveness, and downregulates VEGF secretion by activating AMPK signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.Isoorientin reduced the expression of p-STAT3, ?-catenin, and p-GSK3 as well as downstream effectors TCF1/TCF7 and LEF1 and significantly reduced ?-catenin colocalization in the nucleus. Isoorientin markedly strengthened the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin against SAS and SCC-25. Therefore, combining isoorientin and cisplatin treatments can potentially improve the anticancer effect of cisplatin. Isoorientin inhibited the tumorigenicity and growth of OSCC through the abrogation of Wnt/?-catenin/STAT3 signaling in vivo. Thus, isoorientin disrupted the ?-catenin signaling pathway through the inactivation of STAT3 signaling.","PMCID: PMC5161403

The different mechanisms that have been proposed for the inhibition of EGFR by EGCG include 1) interfering with the binding of EGF to EGFR and inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity [67], 2) altering lipid organization in the plasma membrane (lipid rafts) and inhibiting EGF binding to EGFR [69], and 3) inducing EGFR internalization without activation [70].

Moreover, 4-hydroxychalcone treatment significantly decreased cellular levels of the antioxidant glutathione and increased cellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, 4-hydroxychalcone treatment led to impairments in mitochondrial respiratory function, compared to controls. In support of this, the cytotoxic effect of 4-hydroxychalcone was prevented by co-treatment with either the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a pharmacological inhibitor of oxidative stress-induced cell death (IM-54) or the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenger.an isomer of 4-HC has been reported to induce mitochondrial dysfunctional, depletion of intracellular ATP levels, and increases in ROS, in SH-SY5Y cells [46]. In the current study, we detected significant impairment of cellular OCR in 4HC-treated MYCN-amplified NB cells, including decreases in ATP-linked respiration, proton leak respiration, and the maximal rate of the electron transport chain, which is reflective of uncoupling","PMCID: PMC6915131

A nechanistic study further demonstrated that, through disrupting the interaction between MDM2 protein and VEGF mRNA, gossypol induced MDM2 self-ubiquitination and decreased VEGF translation simultaneously, which resulted in both apoptosis and anti-angiogenesis effects. In vitro, regardless of p53 status, gossypol induced cancer cell apoptosis. In nude mouse xenograft in vivo models, gossypol suppressed tumor growth and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.. Our integrated molecular profiling approach suggests that the inhibitory effect of gossypol is attributable to induction of DNA damage, which consequently leads to the stabilization of p53 and the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.","PMCID: PMC5343402

Western blotting assay revealed that ?-cadinene led to activation of caspases in OVCAR-3 cancer cells. PARP cleavage was noticed at 50 µM dose of ?-cadinene with the advent of the cleaved 85-kDa fragment after exposure to ?-cadinene. At 100 µM, only the cleaved form of PARP was detectable. Pro-caspase-8 expression remained unaltered until 10 µM dose of ?-cadinene. However, at 50 and 100 µM dose, pro-caspase-8 expression was no longer detectable.

The inhibitory activity of herbacetin was associated with markedly reduced NF-?B and AP1 reporter activity.

The ROS-mediated apoptosis induction by hesp in human gall bladder carcinoma was also reported by Pandey et al.,26 but they found cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. A recent25 evidence showed that Hesp is a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV), and by inhibiting CAMKIV along with activating the caspase-3-dependent intrinsic pathway through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein, Bax (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator), Hesp exerts its anti-apoptotic and anticancer activitiesHesp was found to alter the anti-apoptotic scenario by modulating Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, together with enhanced release of cytochrome-c and activation of caspase-3/9. Experimental studies revealed that Hesp initiates apoptosis by inhibiting constitutively activated Aurora-A-mediated PI3K/Akt/GSK-3? pathway, and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway coupled with the stimulation of autophagy in this colon cancer model.28 Hesp in combination with fistein has been reported to inhibit cellular proliferation via triggering programmed cell death in human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells through activation of caspase-3 and JAK/STAT (Janus Kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway and genes of JAK/STAT pathway have also been identified as candidates of CML therapy.29 In ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced renal cancer model of Wistar rats, Hesp was found to induce apoptosis-related proteins caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax expression and downregulation of Bcl-2 (BCL2 apoptosis regulator), NF-?B (nuclear factor kappa B subunit), iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), TNF-? (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression, which were associated with Hesp anti-cancer activities in vivo.30 In xenograft model of colon cancerous mice, Hesp also showed mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. In female BALB/c nude mice, a xenograft tumor model in vivo Hesp inhibited tumor growth, decreased vascular density, inhibited VEGF, and down-regulated NFATc3, VEGF, and VEGFR2 expression via NFAT signaling pathway.50 Further research in the domain of anti-metastatic potential of Hesp in pancreatic cancer has shown to target MKK3/6 and p38 intracellular signaling pathways.51 In A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells, Hesp was described to significantly inhibit tumor migration capability via targeting SDF-1? (stromal cell-derived factor 1) leading to downregulation of CXCR-4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4), p-Akt, p-I?B (phosphorylated-I kappa B), and p-p65 expression (SDF-1/CXCR-4 signaling cascade).52 Hesp was also documented to inhibit cell migration and invasion in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells via wound healing and matrigel assay and in vivo in male BALB/c xenograft mice model.The studies on anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Hesp indicate that Hesp can reduce the level of inflammatory factors such as VCAM-1, COX-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, PGE2 (prostaglandin E2), IL-4, IL-6, iNOS, and NO2.74,76 The anti-oxidative, chelating, and strong reducing properties along with the hydroxyl, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and free radical scavenging activities of Hesp occurred depending on the concentration and originated from the chemical structure by acting as a hydrogen donor to the radical molecules, and played a radical target role to form new complexes between the antioxidant radicals and the lipid radicals thanks to the presence of 300-hydroxy, 400-o-methoxy system in the B ring. Hesperetin derivative-14 (HD-14) has also been reported to have anti-inflammatory potential and has been shown to inhibit p-JAK1/p-STAT2 via PPAR-? upregulation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells.83 Similar results were reported using another Hesperetin derivative-12 (HDND-12) in RAW264.7 cells and were reported to down-regulate p-JAK2/p-STAT3 expression.","PMCID: PMC7082885

(hypoxia inducible factor-1)/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factors) through Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway and then inhibit angiogenesis and cut off nutrient supply (Zhang et al., 2017). VEGF, also known as vascular permeability factor, promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion into surrounding tissues, and is an important factor in tumor angiogenesis (Adams and Alitalo 2007). Therefore, we speculate that ginsenoside Rd can not only inhibit angiogenesis but also inhibit the growth, metastasis and invasion of BC cells by targeting VEGF.Ginsenoside CK can inhibit the proliferation, induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, as well as EMT, through down-regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhang and Li 2016). Moreover, ginsenoside CK can reduce glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?) phosphorylation, which leads to decreased expression of oncoprotein ?-catenin and cyclin D1, thereby induce programmed necrosis of cancer cells Ginsenoside Rh2 can mediate G1/S cell cycle arrest by activating p38 and decreasing cyclin D1 expression (Peng et al., 2022). Moreover, ginsenoside Rh2 mediates G1 phase arrest of BC cells, which is caused by p15 INK4B and p27 kip1 dependent inhibition of CDKs/cyclin complex (Choi et al., 2009). In addition, ginsenoside Rh2 can up-regulate the phosphorylation levels of p53, p38 and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), whereas down-regulate the expression of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), thereby inhibiting the proliferation of BC cells (Ren et al., 2018). It is reported that ginsenoside Rh2 can induce BC cells apoptosis (Park et al., 2022). Studies have shown that ginsenoside Rh2 can increase the expression of TNF? (tumor necrosis factor ?) by up-regulating ER? (estrogen receptor ?), which in turn induces apoptosis of BC cells (Peng et al., 2022). Furthermore, ginsenoside Rh2 induced apoptosis of BC cells was associated with increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bak, Bax and Bim, and decreased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1.ginsenoside Rg3 can affect cell proliferation through a variety of pathways, including inducing protein synthesis, cell division, and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-?B) signaling (Zou et al., 2018), among which, SRg3 inhibits BC cells proliferation by arresting the cell cycle of G0/G1 (Nakhjavani et al., 2019). Furthermore, studies demonstrated that SRg3 induces apoptosis of BC cells through classical mitochondria-dependent caspase activation (Kim et al., 2013). In details, SRg3 inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, as well as induces the instability of mutant p53, thereby blocking NF-?B signal transduction, which in turn decreases the expression of Bcl-2 and ultimately induces apoptosis of BC cells (Kim et al., 2014).

The IHC data revealed that Ki-67 was significantly lower for aPPD treated tumors and was associated with elevated p21 and cleaved caspase-3 expression, compared to vehicle treatment. Furthermore, aPPD decreased AR protein expression in xenograft tumors, while significantly upregulating p27 and Bax protein levels. In vitro data supporting this suggests that aPPD binds to and significantly inhibits the N-terminal or the DNA binding domains of AR. The AR androgen binding site docking score for androgen (dihydrotestosterone) was ?11.1, while that of aPPD was ?7.1. The novel findings described herein indicate aPPD potently inhibits PCa in vivo partly via inhibition of a site on the AR N-terminal domain. This manifested as cell cycle arrest and concurrent induction of apoptosis via an increase in Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, p27 and p21 expression.","PMCID: PMC5940378

As a result, ?-PAE abated hypoxia-induced HCC cell growth, proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT and facilitated apoptosis in vitro and in vivo dose-dependently. Further mechanism studies displayed that ?-PAE inactivated the NF-?B/HIF-1? pathway, and HIF-1? activation significantly reversed the ?-PAE-mediated tumor inhibition. ?-PAE repressed the proliferation and EMT of hypoxia-induced HCC cells by choking the NF-?B/HIF-1? pathway, suggesting that ?-PAE was a potential drug for HCC treatment.?-PAE chokes the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (I?B), declines the expression of inflammatory factor tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), increases the activity of cyclooxygenases cyctoxase-1 (COX-1) and cyctoxase-2 (COX-2), up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor and pro-angiogenic proteins, and dose-dependently reduces indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats.?-Patchoulene protected against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury by dampening inflammatory responses and oxidative stress through inactivation of NF-?B and activation of Nrf2 [11]. The NF-?B pathway activation is associated with the occurrence and evolvement of various tumors, including HCC [11]. Several studies have manifested that NF-?B targets and up-regulates 17?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4), down-regulates estradiol E2, up-regulates interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclin D1, and induces the proliferation of HCC HepG2 cells [12]. Besides, PHD-finger domain protein 5a (PHF5A) knockout hampers HCC cell migration and invasion by suppressing the activation of the NF-?B pathway. Blocking the NF-?B pathway attenuates PHF5A-mediated pro-migrative and invasive effects [13]. These findings suggest that NF-?B is a new therapeutic target for HCC. Nonetheless, the function of ?-PAE in regulating NF-?B in HCC remains elusive.","PMCID: PMC9275994

Furthermore, dicentrine inhibits the TNF-?-induced A549 cells invasion and migration. This inhibition is correlated with the suppression of invasive proteins in the presence of dicentrine. Moreover, dicentrine significantly blockes TNF-?-activated TAK1, p38, JNK, and Akt, leading to reduced levels of the transcriptional activity of NF-?B and AP-1. ",doi: 10.3390/molecules24224100

Computational studies predicted that solasodine showed a high affinity with the Gli1 zinc finger domain that resulted from hydrogen-bonds to the THR243 and ASP216 amino acids residues. In addition, solasodine specifically bound with Gli1 and enhanced Gli1 protein stability in MCF7 cells.","doi: 10.1111/cas.13354, DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154448"
